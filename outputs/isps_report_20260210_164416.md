# ISPS – Strategy–Action Alignment Report
Generated: **2026-02-10 16:44 UTC**
## 1. Executive Summary
- Total strategies analyzed: **29**
- Partial: **13**
- Not Covered (Year-1): **11**
- Strong: **4**
- Weak: **1**

Key message: The system aligns strategies to actions using embeddings + Chroma, and proposes improvements (rewrites + KPIs) using an LLM with evaluation loop.
## 2. Key Findings
- Lowest-alignment (Weak) strategies (top 1):
  - **SO3.1**: Increase annual research output to 200+ publications in indexed journals by 2028 → best action **A3.2** (boosted=0.529)

## 3. Recommendations (LLM Strategy Improvement Generator)
- No saved LLM improvements found yet. Generate suggestions in the dashboard first.
## 4. Knowledge Graph View (Strategy → Action → KPI)
The dashboard visualizes Strategy → top Action(s) → KPI(s) generated by the LLM.
For each improved strategy, KPI nodes are linked to the cited action(s) to preserve traceability.
