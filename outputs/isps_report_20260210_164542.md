# ISPS – Strategy–Action Alignment Report
Generated: **2026-02-10 16:45 UTC**
## 1. Executive Summary
- Total strategies analyzed: **29**
- Partial: **13**
- Not Covered (Year-1): **11**
- Strong: **4**
- Weak: **1**

Key message: The system aligns strategies to actions using embeddings + Chroma, and proposes improvements (rewrites + KPIs) using an LLM with evaluation loop.
## 2. Key Findings
- Lowest-alignment (Weak) strategies (top 1):
  - **SO3.1**: Increase annual research output to 200+ publications in indexed journals by 2028 → best action **A3.2** (boosted=0.529)

## 3. Recommendations (LLM Strategy Improvement Generator)
### SO3.1
- Issue: `not_covered`
- Cited action(s): A3.2, A3.3
- Alignment: before=0.529, after=0.705, delta=0.176

**Proposed improved strategy:**
> Increase annual research output to 200+ publications in indexed journals by 2028 through the establishment of a robust Research Grant Application Support Program, which aims to secure $2M in funding for 40 grant applications. Additionally, enhance the visibility and impact of our research outputs by launching targeted postgraduate recruitment campaigns.

**KPIs:**
- Annual research publications: Number of indexed journal articles | target=200+ per year | timeframe=2024-2028
- Grant applications submitted: Number of grant applications | target=40 | timeframe=2024-2028
- New postgraduate enrollments: Number of students enrolled | target=150 (50 PhD, 100 Master's) | timeframe=2024-2028

## 4. Knowledge Graph View (Strategy → Action → KPI)
The dashboard visualizes Strategy → top Action(s) → KPI(s) generated by the LLM.
For each improved strategy, KPI nodes are linked to the cited action(s) to preserve traceability.
